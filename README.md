# Linked-List-DataStructure
An all-inclusive guide to linked lists, covering their structures, operations (insertion, deletion, and traversal), and comparative advantages. Dive into singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. Explore code snippets in java implementation. Master the potential of linked lists in this comprehensive resource

# LinkedList Concepts

## Singly LinkedList

### Creation of Singly LinkedList
- Traversal of Singly LinkedList
  - Length of list
  - Printing the list

### Insertion Operations
- Insertion at First position
- Insertion at Last position
- Insertion at Middle position
- Insertion at i'th position
- Insertion at i'th position from the end
- Insertion at particular node value
- Insertion at First index
- Insertion at last index
- Insertion at Middle index
- Insertion at i'th index
- Insertion at i'th index from the end

### Deletion Operations
- Deletion of node at First position
- Deletion of node at Last position
- Deletion of node at Middle position
- Deletion of node at i'th position
- Deletion of node at i'th position from the end
- Deletion of node at First index
- Deletion of node at Last index
- Deletion of node at Middle index
- Deletion of node at i'th index
- Deletion of node at i'th index from the end
- Deletion of particular node
- Deletion of particular valued node

### Searching Operations
- Linear Search on linkedlist
- Find an element in linkedlist
- Binary Search on linkedlist

### Sorting Operations
- Sort the linkedlist by Bubble Sort
- Sort the linkedlist by Insertion Sort
- Sort the linkedlist by Selection Sort
- Sort the linkedlist by Merge Sort
- Sort the linkedlist by Quick Sort

### Other Operations
- Reverse the linkedlist
- Palindrome linkedlist
